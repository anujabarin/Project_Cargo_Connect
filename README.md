# Project_Cargo_Connect
Airports serve as critical hubs for global trade, yet inefficiencies in freight operations such as
restricted access controls, fragmented data ecosystems, and infrastructure bottlenecks result in
delays, missed deadlines, and increased costs. The Cargo Connect project addresses these
challenges by proposing a solution that leverages real-time data integration, predictive scheduling,
and adaptive routing algorithms.
